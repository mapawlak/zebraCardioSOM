# zebraCardioSOM
Self-organising maps of RNA-seq data of developing zebrafish cardiomyocytes (Pawlak et al. Genome Research, 2019). `oposSOM` R package was used to analise rld-normalized gene counts (`DESeq2`).  

neg - negative samples (no GFP signal)
pos - positive samples (GFP signal)
samples are from wt unless indicated gata5, tbx5, hand2 (these are TFs double KO)
